Who holds the record for being the most successful athlete in the history of the Olympics?

Local:
Tell me something about the origin of the number 42

Architecture:
I would like to create an Azure architecture diagram. 
The architecture should include a subscription with two ResourceGroups. 
Each ResourceGroup will contain Azure Function apps, a storage account, and a SQL Database.
All the Function apps should be connected to a single key vault, which will be deployed in a separate ResourceGroup named SharedResource. 
The SharedResource group will also include an Azure LogAnalytics workspace and Application Insights, both of which will be utilized by the Function apps.
Additionally, the Function apps will be connected to the SQL Database and the storage account within their respective ResourceGroups. 

Finally, please add an Ingress ResourceGroup that contains an API Management service, which will be connected to the Function apps
