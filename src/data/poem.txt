In a land where binary trees sway,
A developer toiled night and day.
With logic sharp as a compiler's bite,
They sought a creature of purest light.

Through forests of code and streams of data,
Past bugs and errors that would come later,
They ventured deep into the cyber thicket,
With a heart full of hope and a debug ticket.

A unicorn, they heard, roamed these parts,
A mythic beast in the techy arts.
With mane like fiber optics aglow,
And hooves that tapped a silent morse code.

The developer, with an algorithmic spell,
Cast a net of queries, woven well.
But the unicorn was a crafty one,
Dodging capture, it would not be outdone.

In the end, as the moon rode high,
The developer let out a weary sigh.
For some things in this digital age,
Are not meant to be caught, even by the sage.

Yet, in the glow of their monitor's light,
They glimpsed a horn, oh so bright.
The unicorn, with a nod of its head,
Had come to them, no more to be said.

In pixels and dreams, it would remain,
A symbol of what we strive to attain.
For in the chase and in the quest,
The journey's where we find our best.
